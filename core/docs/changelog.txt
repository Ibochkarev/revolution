## [MODx 0.9.7-alpha-1 (LastChangedRevision: 3664)] - 2008-04-28
### Added
- Added new resource import routine for creating resources from static content on the file system, as any valid modResource derivative.
- Introducing context support to the manager resource trees.
- Add conditional to check for $GLOBALS['https_port'] before attempting to use it.
- Add-on installation has been removed from setup in preparation for adding it to the manager itself.
- Added/updated delegate controllers, templates, and processors for modWebLink and modStaticResource.
- Added new static resource option to document tree context menus.
- Introduction of new setup using transport packages (new installs only for now).
- [xPDO] Add support for package specific include paths for models.
- Added checkForLocks func to modx.class.php
- Added checkIfIn to modmanager095.class.php, to do the annoying check if in manager in all the pages
- Added splitter class for tables to get the line effect found in user management
- Added ul.no_list to get list effect without bullets
- Added formhandler.js - handles validation in forms by sending form through AJAX call. If response != true, then outputs response to a div with id 'errormsg'. Also evaluates JS scripts in the response.
- [xPDO] Introduction of xPDOQuery for building SQL queries using only objects and the API.
- Added $modx->getTree() function for easily getting a tree structure of MODx resource ids in the current context.
- Added modXMLRPCResource, modXMLRPCResponse classes and supporting code, including modified XML-RPC for PHP code (from version 2.1).  You can now create resources that represent XMLRPC servers and clients.
- Added check to verify keys passed to modX::getPlaceholder() are valid strings to avoid PHP errors.
- Add ability to locate and use original manager/config/config.inc.php to upgrade directly on legacy installations.
- Added some new configuration options for session handling and various caching features; more to come.
- [xPDO] Added additional logic to xPDO::loadClass() which will return an error immediately if no class name is provided.
- Added session table to install script due to failure of auto-table creation on some environments.
- Few tweaks to modX::_initSession function (was setting session_name twice).
- Added stripslashes() to modRequest::_sanitize() when working with magic_quotes_gpc enabled.
- Added proper escapes to deprecated modX::getFullTableName() to fix issues when dashes (-) or other reserved (My)SQL characters appear in a database name.
- Added missing modX::getSettings() method.
- Add missing webAlert function to new modX class.
- [New feature] Allow custom error handler classes.
- [New feature] Fine-grained configuration options for caching pages, database results, or disabling the cache altogether (see system settings starting with `cache.`).  Turn the different caching options on/off or set a default time-to-live for those items being cached.
- [New feature] Database result-set and xPDO object caching, with support for memcache, native-JSON object caching for high-performance AJAX requests.
- [New feature] Configurable session management with default implementation configured for modSessionHandler, an xPDO-based implementation that stores sessions in a database, and allows a great deal of configurability, by site and/or context.
- [New feature] Contexts allows a site to be organized into sub-sites, subdomains, etc, and override any system settings by context.  The default contexts are 'web' and 'mgr' to support the legacy ideas of front-end and back-end session contexts.
- Introducing the new MODx core built on top of xPDO; this will incrementally replace the entire existing codebase, but can co-exist until 1.0 release and provides about 90 to 95% legacy compatibility for existing tags and add-ons.

- Upgrades now work for previous 0.9.7 installations
- Fixed bug with chunk update processor deleting the chunk content.

- Updated MODx model for modUserSettings and modWebUserSettings with appropriate primary key indexes and field types.

- Emulated PDO can now be forced in PHP 5.1+ when PDO class is already available, but the required drivers are not available.
- Modified $modx->resourceMap to a simpler structure and optimized getParentIds() and getChildIds() functions.  $modx->documentMap still holds the old structure but is deprecated.

- Translated all core files and data in the core distribution/installation to the new native tag format.
- Optimized modParser, removing run-time translation with modParser095 from normal execution and added modTranslate095 utility class, which can translate tags in database and file content, writing a log of the translation and/or making the changes to the database and files.  modParser095 is experimental, and not recommended, as there are too many issues with mixed tags being parsed incorrectly.
- Fix to make sure modX::parseChunk removes replacement placeholders for empty values.

- modX::_initSession() updated to better handle situations where session_set_save_handler() fails when trying to override default PHP session handling.
- [xPDO] Modified fromArray() so it is not responsible for determining the _new attribute of xPDOObject instances.  This is the responsibility of xPDO::getObject(), which uses xPDO::load(), and xPDO::getCollection().

- Fix WebUser login -- weblogin.processor.inc.php.
- Fix makeUrl() -- no longer needs to add base_url.
